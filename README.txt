You can automatically generate certificates for course participants after they complete the course with the
Moodle Certificate plugin. With this plugin, you can easily incorporate the certificate feature into your
Moodle LMS platform. After completing the course, the course participants can view and download their
certificate from the page where you positioned the certificate block plugin.
Steps in the certificate creation process:
- After installing the plugin, the certificate design is configured from the plugin&#39;s settings page. You
add the certificate title and certificate subtitle from here.
- After the configuration, it will be possible to produce certificates for all courses.
- To be able to produce a certificate, the course completion criteria must be determined on the
course page. For example, you can ensure that the course is completed after all course activities
are completed.
- You can add the block plugin to the course page or the dashboard page.
Elements seen on the certificate:
- Certificate headline
- Course name
- Participant name
- Certificate subtitle
- Date
- Moodle Platform Name
